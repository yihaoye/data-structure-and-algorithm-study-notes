Write an SQL query to find the most recent order(s) of each product.

Return the result table ordered by product_name in ascending order and in case of a tie by the product_id in ascending order. If there still a tie, order them by order_id in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |

Output: 
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |
| keyboard     | 1          | 7        | 2020-08-01 |
| mouse        | 2          | 8        | 2020-08-03 |
| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
Explanation: 
keyboard's most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse's most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen's most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we do not include it in the result table.
