(movie_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the rating of a movie by a user in their review.
created_at is the user's review date. 
 

Write an SQL query to:

Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.
The query result format is in the following example.
