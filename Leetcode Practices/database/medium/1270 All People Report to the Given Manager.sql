Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
 

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
| 1           | Boss          | 1          |
| 3           | Alice         | 3          |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 4           | Daniel        | 2          |
| 7           | Luis          | 4          |
| 8           | Jhon          | 3          |
| 9           | Angela        | 8          |
| 77          | Robert        | 1          |
+-------------+---------------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 2           |
| 77          |
| 4           |
| 7           |
+-------------+
