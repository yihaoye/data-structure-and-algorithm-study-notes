Table: Employee

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| id           | int     |
| company      | varchar |
| salary       | int     |
+--------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the company and the salary of one employee.
 

Write an SQL query to find the rows that contain the median salary of each company. While calculating the median, when you sort the salaries of the company, break the ties by id.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 1  | A       | 2341   |

| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
| 11 | B       | 1221   |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
| 15 | C       | 2645   |
| 16 | C       | 2652   |
| 17 | C       | 65     |
+----+---------+--------+
Output: 
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 5  | A       | 451    |
| 6  | A       | 513    |
| 12 | B       | 234    |
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   |
+----+---------+--------+
Explanation: 
For company A, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 3  | A       | 15     |
| 2  | A       | 341    |
| 5  | A       | 451    | <-- median
| 6  | A       | 513    | <-- median
| 1  | A       | 2341   |
| 4  | A       | 15314  |
+----+---------+--------+
For company B, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 8  | B       | 13     |
| 7  | B       | 15     |
| 12 | B       | 234    | <-- median
| 11 | B       | 1221   | <-- median
| 9  | B       | 1154   |
| 10 | B       | 1345   |
+----+---------+--------+
For company C, the rows sorted are as follows:
+----+---------+--------+
| id | company | salary |
+----+---------+--------+
| 17 | C       | 65     |
| 13 | C       | 2345   |
| 14 | C       | 2645   | <-- median
| 15 | C       | 2645   |

SELECT Id, Company, Salary
FROM 
    (SELECT
        id, 
        company, 
        salary, 
		row_number() over(PARTITION BY company ORDER BY salary) salaryrank, 
		COUNT(*) over(PARTITION BY company) tte 
    FROM employee) AS foo
WHERE salaryrank >= tte/2 AND salaryrank <= tte/2+1;
/*
tte: total employee of the company.
思路：先在各公司做薪水排名，排名在 [员工总数，员工总数+1] 区间内的员工就是领中位数薪水的。
