/**
Given the root of a binary search tree and a node p in it, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

 

Example 1:
https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG

Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

Example 2:
https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
All Nodes will have unique values.
