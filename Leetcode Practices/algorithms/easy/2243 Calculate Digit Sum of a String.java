/**
You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
Return s after all rounds have been completed.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
Output: "135"
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return "135" as the answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "00000000", k = 3
Output: "000"
Explanation: 
We divide s into "000", "000", and "00".
Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, and 0 + 0 = 0. 
s becomes "0" + "0" + "0" = "000", whose length is equal to k, so we return "000".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
2 <= k <= 100
s consists of digits only.

// My Solution:
class Solution {
    public String digitSum(String s, int k) {
        /*
            模拟算法+递归
        */
        if (s.length() <= k) return s;
        int sum = 0;
        StringBuilder strB = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if (i != 0 && i % k == 0) {
                strB.append(sum);
                sum = 0;
            }
            sum += s.charAt(i) - '0';
        }
        strB.append(sum);
        return digitSum(strB.toString(), k);
    }
}
