/**
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-104 < nums[i], target < 10^4
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.
 */



// My Solution:
class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        // 二分搜索
        int left = 0, right = nums.length-1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
            else if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
            else return mid;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
