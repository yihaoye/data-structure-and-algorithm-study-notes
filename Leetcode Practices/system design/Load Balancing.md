LB helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases. It also keeps track of the status of all the resources while distributing requests. (Between the user and the web server; Between web servers and an internal platform layer, like application servers or cache servers; Between internal platform layer and database)  
* Benefits of Load Balancing
* Load Balancing Algorithms (Health Checks)
  * Least Connection Method
  * Least Response Time Method
  * Least Bandwidth Method
  * Round Robin Method
  * Weighted Round Robin Method
  * IP Hash
* Redundant Load Balancers (LB can be a single point of failure; to overcome this, a second LB can be connected to the first to form a cluster)
