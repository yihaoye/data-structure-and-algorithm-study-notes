Databases operations performance, faster to search through the table and find the row or rows wanted.  
* Example: A library catalog
* How do Indexes decrease write performance? - index speed up data retrieval but slow down data insertion/update/delete (update the index). (unnecessary indexes should be avoided and indexes no longer used should be removed. Adding indexes is to improving read query performance, so if table is write heavy and rarely read, index may not be added)
