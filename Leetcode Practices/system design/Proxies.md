Software/Hardware acts as intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. Typically used to filter, log, transform requests (by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compressing a resource). Another advantage of a proxy server is its cache can serve many similar requests.  
* Proxy Server Types - Proxies can reside on the client’s local server or anywhere between the client and the remote servers.
  * Open Proxy
    * Anonymous Proxy
    * Trаnspаrent Proxy - able to cаche the websіtes.
  * Reverse Proxy - retrieves resources from one or more servers then returned to client as originated from the proxy server itself
