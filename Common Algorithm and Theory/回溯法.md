### 回溯法与 DFS 的区别：
Backtracking is a more general purpose algorithm.  
Depth-First search is a specific form of backtracking related to searching tree structures. From Wikipedia:  
> One starts at the root (selecting some node as the root in the graph case) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  
It uses backtracking as part of its means of working with a tree, but is limited to a tree structure.  
Backtracking, though, can be used on any type of structure where portions of the domain can be eliminated - whether or not it is a logical tree. The Wiki example uses a chessboard and a specific problem - you can look at a specific move, and eliminate it, then backtrack to the next possible move, eliminate it, etc.

回溯是一种通用的算法，把问题分步解决，在每一步都试验所有的可能，当发现已经找到一种方式或者目前这种方式不可能是结果的时候，退回上一步继续尝试其他可能。很多时候每一步的处理都是一致的，这时候用递归来实现就很自然。
